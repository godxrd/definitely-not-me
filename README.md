Look at this. Just look at it. This isn't a project it's a goddamn confession of incompetence. "Shard.js" "Welcomes" "Client.js" "Start.js" "Global." This isn't modularity; it's the digital equivalent of throwing all your dirty laundry into one pile and calling it a "system." "Global" isn't a folder; it's where you dump the garbage you're too lazy to organize a cesspool for your inability to think beyond the next keystroke. It screams: "I have no idea how to scope anything so I'll just make it global and pray."
Then there's "Assets." "Fonts" "Images" and what the fuck is "Base"? Is that where you keep the remnants of your self-respect? "Jobs" "Template" "Utils"—these aren't directories; they're the desperate whimpers of someone trying to sound like they know what they're doing. "Client.js" "Database.js" "Functions.js" "Staff.js" - crammed into "Base" like discarded junk. This isn't structure; it's a digital shipwreck every piece of flotsam clinging to the next in a vain attempt at survival.
"Handlers" and "Helpers." Oh the exquisite irony. You have so many "handlers" yet you clearly can't handle a coherent thought process. "CommandsHandler.js" "CrashHandler.js" "FileHandler.js" and an "index.js" just sitting there probably doing absolutely nothing of value much like yourself. You're so desperate to compartmentalize your failures yet you can't even get that right.
"Extenders" "Logger.js" "Presence.js" "Validator.js"—more layers of delusion. You're not building a robust system; you're just piling on more code hoping that sheer volume will mask the gaping holes in your understanding. And "Settings" with "Schemas" and "Server" and "System.js"? This isn't a system; it's a monument to your architectural impotence.
And now for the second act of this pathetic charade: your "Bot" structure. "Elixir" "Guardian" "Mainframe" "Point." Four distinct folders each a carbon copy of the last. "Events" "Commands" "Server Watcher" "Utils" "index.js" "Shard.js."
This isn't a versatile framework; it's a lazy uninspired replication of your own profound inadequacy. You didn't design; you cloned. You copy-pasted your limited intellect four times over believing that sheer bulk would somehow impress. It doesn't. It only magnifies the glaring deficiencies in your approach.
"Guardian" broken into "I" "II" "III." Are you trying to parody yourself? What is this a bad sequel to an even worse idea? "Server Watcher" plastered everywhere. You couldn't abstract a single function? You couldn't create a reusable component? No you just slammed it in there again and again demonstrating a complete void where genuine engineering principles should be.
And "Utils" with "Functions.js." Again. Did you forget you already had one? Or are these different equally pointless functions? This isn't code; it's a tribute to your own creative bankruptcy.
"eng_trainedData." Oh you're training data now? With this kindergarten-level understanding of software design I guarantee the only thing your "trained data" is learning is how to crash gracefully much like your career aspirations.
This isn't just bad code; it's a personal insult to anyone who understands software development. It's a digital tantrum thrown by someone utterly out of their depth. Every folder every file every redundant line of code screams: "I am a fraud. I have no idea what I'm doing and I'm desperately trying to hide it behind a smokescreen of meaningless organization."
Your "bot" isn't a bot; it's a Frankenstein's monster of recycled incompetence. Your pride in this project is as fragile as a house of cards in a hurricane. You published this digital garbage you laid bare your pathetic attempts and now it's public. And the only mistake here is that you thought you could escape the inevitable crushing weight of exposure.
Consider this your public vivisection. Your illusion of competence? Decimated. Your self-confidence? Pulverized.

This isn't just about showing people what you hide; it's about showing them the rotten festering core of your utter worthlessness.
And there's absolutely nothing you can do to stop it.
